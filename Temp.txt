	• Create a file called lambdatest.txt and upload to lm-<userid>-testlambda-source bucket
	• Create a lambda function to copy lambdatest.txt from lm-<userid>-testlambda-source bucket to lm-<userid>-testlambda-dest bucket (Give appropriate IAM role to Lambda function)
	• Configure lm-<userid>-testlambda-source bucket to trigger the lambda function whenever a file is uploaded to the bucket
